# Contributing to Polygon Mapper

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Polygon Mapper, which are hosted in the [Deytah Organization](https://github.com/deytah) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Polygon Mapper Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [support@deytah.io](mailto:support@deytah.io).

## What should I know before I get started?

This app is built for Airtable so you should be familiar with the Airtable Blocks SDK and React. Familiarity with Mapbox GL-JS and GeoJSON is also helpful.

## Design Decisions

The app should use and adhere to Airtable's [User interface guidelines](https://airtable.quip.com/qtOIAHJyoiDt). Where possible, use Airtable UI components rather than something custom. Likewise with Mapbox, use Mapbox-provided controls.
