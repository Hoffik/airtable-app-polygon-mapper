# Map Viewer for Airtable

Map Viewer uses Mapbox to render GeoJSON stored in Airtable as shapes.

## Requirements

To **use** this app, you will need:
- an Airtable Pro account
- a Mapbox account

To **run** this app, you will need:
- an Airtable base
- a Mapbox Access Token
- a field in your base with GeoJSON **geometry**, named the exact same across all relevant Tables

## Installation

To remix this app as a Custom App: 
1. Create a new base or use an existing one.
2. Create a new app in your base, selecting "Remix from GitHub" as your template.
3. Follow the steps in [Airtable's "Remix from GitHub" guide](https://airtable.com/developers/apps/guides/remix-from-github).
4. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.
5. Run `block release` to publish the app to Airtable's servers so that all collaborators can use it.

_Note: Custom Apps are only available to Base Collaborators. "Share via Base Link" viewers will not be able to use the app._

## How It Works

In View Mode:
- The Map uses the active Table as the data source for the Map.
- The Map loads all records in the active View that have GeoJSON data.
- If applicable, the Map will cluster your shapes at zoomed out levels.
- A View can be Filtered to add/remove records from the Map.
- A View can use Conditions to define colors for shapes on the Map. (Editors and up)
- A Record can be selected and highlighted on the Map by clicking its shape.
- A Record or Records can be selected from the Table and highlighted on the Map.
- The Map will Zoom in/out, if applicable, to the active selection.
- Selected Record(s) are displayed in a Record List under the Map.
- A Record in the Record List can be expanded to view all its details.
- The visible Map Canvas can be downloaded as a PDF with its required Mapbox attribution text. Optionally, add a second attribution line for your dataset.

## Limitations and Restrictions

The options/features you have access to are dependent on your Collaborator type's permissions.

Read only collaborators can use existing Views (to filter the map, if applicable to the View) and Conditions (for fill colors) set by a paid Airtable user.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Draw Mode: Create and save new geometry for records
- [ ] Layer: Background overlay(s) using a linked record parent
- [ ] Toggle: Labels
